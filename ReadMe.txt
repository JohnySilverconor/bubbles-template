Bobble.Net v1.0

DISCLAIMER:
This project has been done for a .Net compact framework contest on www.codeproject.com, and can be freely used or modified by anyone, but i can't guaranty that it will work as expected, nor that it's reliable. I know that there's a lot of things that could be improved (graphics, sounds, score management, level editor, more levels, better hit detection, faster bubble moves, use of GAPI, and so on ...) but i did not have enough time to implement all my ideas, anyway, it's playable and only a v1.0...

You can do whatever you want with this project, but if you modify it, please notify me at Benoit_Mich@hotmail.com.

Thanks !
